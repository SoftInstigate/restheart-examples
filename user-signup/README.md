# User Signup

This example implements a user signup process.

To create an user, an unauthenticated client executes a POST request to `/users`; this creates a new user document.

When the new document gets created:

- the request interceptor `verificationCodeGenerator` adds the verification code to the user document and sets `roles: ["UNVERIFIED"]` (the ACL defines no permissions for this role)
- the async response interceptor `emailVerificationSender` sends the verification email with the link to the `userVerifier` service with the verification code passed via a query parameter
- the service `userVerifier` checks the verification code and unlocks (ie. set the roles=["USER"]) the user

## How to build and run

### Download RESTHeart and clone the this repo

You need both **JDK 16++** and **Maven** to build and run this example.

-   [Download RESTHeart](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/releases/)
-   uncompress it: `unzip restheart.zip` or `tar -xvf restheart.tar.gz`
-   Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:SoftInstigate/restheart-examples.git`
-   `cd` into the `restheart-examples` folder

### Build and run it

1. `cd user-signup`
1. Build the plugin with `./mvnw package` (uses the maven-dependency-plugin to copy the jar of the external dependency to /target/lib)
1. Copy both the plugins JAR `target/user-signup.jar` and `target/lib/*` into the directory `../../restheart/plugins/`
1. Start MongoDB on your localhost.
1. `cd` into the restheart directory
1. Edit the `etc/restheart.yml`as described in the following section **Configuration**
1. Start the process: `java -jar restheart.jar etc/restheart.yml -e etc/default.properties`.

### Configuration

You need to configure the `emailVerificationSender` interceptor with the connection parameters of an SMTP server (needed to send the verification emails). Add the following snippet to the `plugins-args` section of `etc/restheart.yml` (this has been tested with Gmail but any SMTP server with SSL support should work):

```
plugins-args:
  emailVerificationSender:
    verifier-srv-url: http://127.0.0.1:8080/verify
    from: <your-email-address>
    from-name: <your-name>
    host: smtp.gmail.com
    port: 465
    smtp-username: <your-gmail-address>
    smtp-password: <your-gmail-password>
```

> For Gmail you might need to enable "less secure app access" to Gmail as described [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)

Set `mongoRealmAuthenticator` as the authenticator for the basic authentication mechanism:

```
auth-mechanisms:
  basicAuthMechanism:
    enabled: true
    authenticator: mongoRealmAuthenticator
```

## Validation

[JSON Schema Validation](https://restheart.org/docs/json-schema-validation/) is used to enforce the schema to the user document.

> The following request use [httpie](https://httpie.org) http cli client.


#### Create the schema store

```
$ http -a admin:secret PUT :8080/_schemas
```


#### Create the JSON Schema for user

```
$ echo '{"_id":"user","$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#","type":"object","properties":{"_id":{"type":"string","pattern":"^\\\w+@[a-zA-Z_]+?.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}$"},"password":{"type":"string"},"roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"code":{"type":"string"}},"required":["_id","password"],"additionalProperties":false}' | http -a admin:secret POST :8080/_schemas
```

#### Update the metadata of /users to apply the schema validation

```
$ echo '{"jsonSchema":{"schemaId":"user"}}' | http -a admin:secret PUT :8080/users
```

## ACL

To allow unauthenticated clients to create user documents add the following permission to `/acl`:

```
$ echo '{"_id":{"$oid":"5da0510e5cf10c7dbfc2ffb2"},"predicate":"path['/users'] and method[POST]","roles":["$unauthenticated"],"priority":1,"readFilter":null,"writeFilter":null}' | http POST :8080/acl
```

Give the role `USER` some permissions on the collection `/coll`

```
$ echo '{"_id":{"$oid":"5f0f0e1785a5d15404f953bb"},"predicate":"path-prefix['/coll'] and (method[PUT] or method[POST] or method[GET])","roles":["USER"],"priority":1,"readFilter":null,"writeFilter":null}' | http -a admin:secret POST :8080/acl
```

## Create user and verify the email address 

The following unauthenticated request creates the user document with your email address:

```
$ http :8080/users _id=<your-email-address> password=<your-password>
```

The new user will automatically get the role `UNVERIFIED` and the verification email will be sent. Clicking on the link in the verification email unlocks the user giving her the role 'USER'.

For a complete guide on how to check the user credentials read [Suggested way to check credentials](https://restheart.org/docs/security/how-clients-authenticate/#suggested-way-to-check-credentials).

In short, the `/roles` service can be used to check the user credentials. It returns the user roles. If the user has not yet verified the email, calling the roles service with the correct credentials returns the role `UNVERIFIED` and the UX should display an error message saying that the email address has not been verified.

```
$ http -a <your-email-address>:<your-password> :8080/roles/<your-email-address>

{
    "authenticated": true, 
    "roles": [
        "UNVERIFIED"
    ]
}
```

Let try to create the collection `/coll` with the new user. The request fails with `403 Forbidden` because the user has role `UNVERIFIED` and no permissions are given to it.

```
http -a <your-email-address>:<your-password> PUT :8080/coll

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
```

Check the email and verify your address by clicking in the verification link. 

Now the roles service will return the role `USER`. 

```
$ http -a <your-email-address>:<your-password> :8080/roles/<your-email-address>

{
    "authenticated": true, 
    "roles": [
        "USER"
    ]
}
```

Let try to create the collection `/coll` with the verified user. The request succeeds with `201 Created` because the user has now role `USER` and it has a permission to execute the request.

```
http -a <your-email-address>:<your-password> PUT :8080/coll

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```
